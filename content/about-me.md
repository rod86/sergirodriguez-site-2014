I am Sergi Rodriguez, a web developer specialised in HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Responsive web design and PHP. 

I am self-motivated, hard worker with a “can do” attitude and a good team player. I am always keeping myself updated with the latest webs trends reading books and articles.

I have studied training courses about Networking and Applications Development in Barcelona where I was introduced to networking and programing languages like Basic.Net, C#.Net, ASP 3.0 and PHP.
Finally I ended starting to work with open source web technologies like PHP and MySQL in several companies in Barcelona, most of them digital agencies. During this period, I changed job a few times and I learned different ways to work and adapt to different types and sizes of teams.

After a few years I decided to seek more challenges and improve my career as a developer abroad and then I started to look for a new job. I got the chance to move to London with a job. Later I changed job and finally I moved to Brighton where I am working.

In my spare time, I have studied other technologies such as Java, Prestashop, Wordpress and Android on my own. I have also built a few applications in Android ([PassGenerator](/portfolio/project/passgenerator "PassGenerator") and [MyFeeds](/portfolio/project/myfeeds "MyFeeds")).
